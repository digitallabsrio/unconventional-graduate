  "course_name": "Building Practical Applications with Redis Using Go - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value data structure store that belongs to the NoSQL category of databases. Go is a programming language known for its performance, simplicity, and reliability. Redis can be used as a high-performance in-memory cache, a message broker and streaming engine. This course teaches you how to use Redis with Go to build practical applications.\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn Redis data types, such as string and Hash. Then, you’ll cover data structures. Moreover, you’ll learn about Redis messaging through list, Pub/Sub and streams. You will also cover Redis’ core features, such as Redis pipeline, notifications, and Lua scripting. This course will finish with geospatial indexes, Redis Cluster and RediSearch. \n \nThis course will give you the ability to build practical applications with Redis and Go. \nYou will gain an understanding of how to choose the appropriate Redis data structures and features, as well as enable you to architect scalable applications.",
